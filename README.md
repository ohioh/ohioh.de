As you have mentioned our github looks a bit different. At the moment you are in the main repository. This repository has more text and documentation.
The reason is that we wish to give you as a new user an easy description to the project by it self and then go with you to the repository you are interested at.
On more benifit on this way is that it is easier to handle. All Documentations are here. For you as a user it is easiert to follow aspecially to see updates in the update section.For us as voluntary for you it is easier to handle and stay tuned too.

The goal of this documentation is to make an understandable possibility to look in the code as a non-coder. Maybe you will not unterstand all at the beginning but if your are interested you should get a start as easy as possible.

The easiest way to get started is  to use the Chrome-Browser. If you are not still using this, please  install it.
After done work go the document https://github.com/ohioh/ohioh.de/tree/master/Chrome to get next interesting information about the Development Tool inside.

# The difference between PCF APPs and OHIOH:

# Progressive Web App:
Two reasons for us to go an other way with the app then Pathcheck. On this point thousands thanks to PCF for the help.
1.Expirience
extreme fast and every actual, progressive Enhancement for a maximal flexibility for you.
As we mentioned that a lot of users are interested in the traffic, we are able to decide differnent ways to get updates,uploads and downloads for the app.
This Traffic is necessary to get the newest information. As an example: This information can give you a push notification if you are influenced by the virus.
We are able to giv eyou the choice how the traffic should happen. You can use only WIFI and will loose no traffic from your mobild data.

# Versions:
We try to use the newest version of the packagemanagers like npm, yarn or podfiles.
In one way this is more risky at our beginning but we hope to give you the newst avaible experince in the APP


# Goal: 

[glimpse: field research, App-development, public health, risk scoring]

We are a collective of voluntary helpers and student from all over the world. Togehter we work at the OHIOH ("Our Helath In Our Hands") Workgroup to explore newst technologies, Protocols (like GAEN or TCN) and User-Behavior to publish public Documents. On this way we want to help to fight corona and non-pandemics like flue. Educational work is nessesary to give the users of tracing App and influenced person a fair chance to decide the own privat way to use APPs. For further information we publish technologies which helps public Authorities like school, universities or Town halls to define there individual risk places and develop fact oriented instructions for action and the restart after covid-19.

Modualar built wih webpack  to get an easy interoperability.

# Project Summary:

In the last month we worked on differnet project of development to fight covid-19. The colobaration to the university of applied sciences of Kiel and the PatchCheckfoundation ( https://pathcheck.org ) helped us to create a research field and envirnment for Data acquisition. The Pathcheck Foundation build with us an App that works in this closed research field of the university.
